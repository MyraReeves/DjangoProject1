# Django

This school project was my first experience using Django. The assignment included the use of a virtual environment.  

As an introduction to Django, the project included a server with a database containing a model for the staff of a mock hotel to log-in and add catering items for sale.  In addition, the assignment used template tags, an HTML homepage containing For and If loops to access an array, and CSS.
