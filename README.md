# ðŸ’» Django

These files are part of my first experience using a Django web framework. The school assignment included practice using the `venv` module to create isolated virtual Python environments.

As an introduction to Django, the project included a server with a database containing a model for the staff of a mock hotel to log-in and add catering items for sale.  In addition, the assignment used template tags, an HTML homepage containing For and If loops to access an array, and CSS.
