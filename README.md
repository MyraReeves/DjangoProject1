# ðŸ’» Django

These files are part of my first experience using a Django web framework. The school assignment practiced using the `venv` module to create isolated virtual Python environments for each Django project. The assignment also included a very brief interaction (querying the objects manager and then creating an object) thru the shell directly within the command prompt window.  However, most of the database entries were created via a superuser account on the Django admin site.  That database consisted of food (restaurant or room service) menu items for sale at a mock hotel.

The main focus of the second half of the project was to create a website GUI for the mock restaurant management to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete the food menu items easily and directly from HTML webpages.

Other details of the school assignment included:

* Learning how to use static files within Django
* Template tags to make the structure more modular
* Dictionary objects passed between the views methods and the templates
* For and If loops to access the array of restaurant menu items
