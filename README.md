# ðŸ’» Django

These files are part of my first experience using a Django web framework. The school assignment included practice using the `venv` module to create isolated virtual Python environments. It also included brief interaction (querying the objects manager and creating a Product object) with the app thru the shell within the command prompt.

As an introduction to Django, the project included a server with a database containing a model for a dev team to be able to log into. That database contained food (restaurant or room service) menu items for sale at a mock hotel.  The main focus of the last half of the project was to create a website GUI for mock administration staff of the mock hotel to be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete those food menu items directly from HTML webpages without needing to log into the server's admin console. In addition to the static (CSS and image) files, the backend assignment used template tags to make the structure more modular, dictionary objects being passed between the views methods and the templates, and For and If loops to access the array.
